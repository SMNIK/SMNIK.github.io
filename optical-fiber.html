<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The optical cable is known as a useful method and equipment for transmitting data in communication technology which 
made by drawing glass (silica) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair and works with laser 
source (single or multiple modes). The optical fiber communication process transmits a signal in the form of light which is 
first converted into the light from electrical signals and transmitted, and then vice versa happens on the receiving side.
The main difference between copper and fiber optical cable is the range and volume of data can pass from each one. In the 
copper cable, data transmission is confined by electron inside the conductive materials which obey from Quantum Mechanic 
rolls, that are related to a free electron gas. As we know the speed of a free-electron inside the conductor is about ten 
times slower than light. Moreover, the frequency of free electron in a conductor has a limitation, because the 
electron-nucleus and e-e interaction cause of heating, and heating in the system is a huge problem ( because it destroys 
the conductivity and resistivity of the material and so destroys the frequency).
However, not only the light speed is extremely faster than an electron but also the frequency of it is higher 
(depends on the emitting system). The application of optical fiber these days is huge range as industry, medical, 
communication and art designing. However, the main application is transfer data.</p>

<h3>Fiber optic cable structure</h3>
<p>The optical cable consists of several different parts, each of which plays a significant role. External  
jackets and buffer tubes protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiberâ€™s 
performance and long-term durability. Optical fibers typically include a core surrounded by a transparent cladding 
material with a lower index of refraction. Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of total internal refraction 
which causes the fiber to act as a wave-guide. Fibers that support many propagation paths or transverse modes are 
called multi-mode fibers, while those that support a single mode are called single-mode fibers (SMF).
Fiber with a core diameter less than about ten times the wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using 
geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic wave-guide structure, by the solution of Maxwell's 
equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation.</p><br>

<h3>Why Fiber is used?</h3>
<p>The fiber wires have replaced the copper wire as transmission cable since it has more advantages than 
the electrical cable:
<ul>
<li><strong>Large transmission capacity: </strong>A single silica fiber can carry hundreds of thousands of telephone channel, 
utilizing only a small part the theoretical capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Small losses: </strong>Approximately 0.2dB/km signal is lost for modern single-mode silica fibers so that many 
tens of kilometers can be bridged without amplifying the signals.</li>
<li><strong>Easy amplification: </strong>A large number of channels can be re-amplified in a single fiber amplifier if 
required for very large transmission distances.</li>
<li><strong>Low cost: </strong>A Due to the huge transmission rate achievable, the cost per transported bit can be extremely 
low.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight: </strong>Compared with electrical cables, fiber-optic cables are very lightweight.</li>
<li><strong>No interference: </strong>Fiber optic cables are immune to problems that arise with electrical cables, such as 
ground loops or electromagnetic interference (EMI).</li><br>
</ul>
</p><br>

<h3>Characteristic of fiber optic communication:</h3>
<p>In optical fiber communication, light is used as a signal which transmitted inside the optical fiber cable:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bandwidth: </strong>Single laser light dispersion means that a good amount of signal can be transmitted per 
second which results in high bandwidth for long distances.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller diameter: </strong>The diameter of optical fiber cable is about 300 micrometers in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Long-distance signal transmission: </strong>Since the laser light does not disperse, it can be easily 
transmitted over long distances.</li>
<li><strong>Low attenuation: </strong>The fiber is made of glass and laser is traveling through it, the signal 
transmitted has only 0.2 dB/km loss.</li>
<li><strong>Transmission security: </strong>Optical encryption and no presence of the electromagnetic signal make 
the data secure over optical fiber.</li>
</ul>
</p><br>

<h3>Applications of Optical Fiber</h3>
<p>Optical fiber communication is mainly used in the telecommunication industry which uses the optical fiber for:
<ul>
<li>Telephone Signals transmission.</li>
<li>Internet Communication.</li>
<li>Cable Television Signal transmission.</li>
</ul>
</p><br>

<h3>Telecommunication and new generations (5G)</h3>
<p>One of the most important problems was the source of signal for transmission data because of the mixed bandwidth 
destroyer the data. About 60 years ago, after the discovery of the laser system the optical communication improved sharply. 
If we assume the first generation of communication is copper cables, then the second one is the optical systems. Besides, 
for all system if we consider there are three-hardware of transmission devices for signals, involves: data converter to 
signal, signal transmission line and signal to data converter; So, in first-generation everything goes well because all 
three parts work with an electron. However, in the second generation, it is true that the fiber cable transfers data 
faster than the cable but still there are problems of wasting time for convert the electronic signal to the wave and at 
the end of the line convert wave to an electronic signal (EOE converts) (but this system is still faster than 1st 
generation). For this purpose, in the third generation the effort is to change the EOE system completely to the optical 
data analyzers; That means, the data does not need to convert from electronic signal to spectra, the transmitter and 
receiver block works as the light source (this system calls All-Optical Network AON). And only limited AON functions 
have been implemented in commercial networks until now. In this regard, the other technology of transfer signal is 
sending various signals together through the fiber. This system named Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), where 
different carriers are used to transmit more distinct optical signals; more in detail, a multiplexer is used in the 
transmission to send various signals together and a demultiplexer in reception to separate them.
In general believable of the community, 5G communication is made by the wireless and mobile connections. 
However, optics will remain the data-transport backbone of the network.</p><br>

<h3>Goals of 5G</h3>
<p>The top three major goals for 5G usually are listed as:
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced mobile broadband (EMBB): </strong>Providing peak data rates of 10 Gbit/s or more. High level 
of network communications like social media and heavy movies.</li>
<li><strong>Ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC): </strong>Services with the reliability of 99.9999% 
and latency in the millisecond range. Reliability and quick response also will be vital for other devices, such as 
home medical equipment or autopilot of new cars.</li>
<li><strong>Massive machine-type communication (mMTC): </strong>Transporting data among the IoT, a large and varied 
family of devices expected to proliferate to densities of hundreds of thousands per square kilometer. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>Now we know the range and speed of transferring (frequency) are the two most important notes for telecommunication. 
Range lets us transfer more values of data, and frequency controls the speed of transferring. We also know that 
these two parameters are inversely related to each other. Then, higher frequencies have more bandwidth but their 
range is more limited, so the transmitters must be close to users.
</p><br>

<h3>5G</h3>
<p>The signal rate starts from 1 GHz for the earlier mobile and TV, offer wide-area coverage but limited bandwidth 
for slow data rates from the IoT. By improving the technology the frequency raised but the rates decrease. Today 
the frequency for local communications use as a 6 GHz frequency and the distance of cells is between 2 to 50 km 
which depends on population. The higher frequency (27-70 GHz) will be used for 5G technology and bandwidth would 
be huge but the cell distances decrease absolutely.
5G communication contains small cells in the 28 GHz band that will distribute broadband signals short distance, 
with large cells operating over larger areas at frequencies below 6 GHz. When antennas receive the signal, it 
transfers to offices or compiler by an optical cable.
To upgrade the network as a complete approach the 5G hardware will not reach directly into the network core, it just 
transfers huge traffic. So, the growth in the fiber transmission system will be divided between data-centers and the 
external fiber network. Besides, for a new line, we only need to add a router or switch that has its own dedicated 
fiber which means the fiber transmission system growths between datacenters and the external fiber network.
The other main benefit of using optical fiber for new telecommunication generation is the decreasing cost of data 
transfer. The new generation of silicon integrated circuits reduces the cost of bit calculation per second but what 
about transferring! Then, it would be more clear that the telecommunication with new generations of transport systems 
deduces the price of each bit transferring; Which depends on the optical fiber.
For controlling the optic costs is to push the development of pluggable optics, which are standardized modules 
packaging optics and electronics to convert signals between optical and electronic form.
The other benefit of using the optical cable is to spend less money to transfer data by radio systems. For wireless 
transmission data, we need to convert digital data into radio signals. So, this way needs installing the 
radio-generation equipment at the base station to transfers digital data by radio signal between antennas. However, 
that requires installing the equipment at radio transmitters, which can be expensive and can add to maintenance costs.
Afterward, The best alternative of the old radio system should be the radio over fiber system which radio signal forms 
that can be transmitted optically through a fiber. The advantage of antennas just appears when there are multi-signal 
and plenty of users to connect to the data which require sensitive equipment to process. 
The main problem that steel remains is the 28 GHz frequency antennas need to be close about 100 meters and could not 
pass the concrete and brick walls. One approach is the fiber send the signal directly to the houses (Raf Meersman). 
The other way is building a single network that declines total cost.
However, in the total approach transferring data to all-region is the main property. Fixed wireless transmission in 
the radio and optical bands has been used for a long time, and offers a way to avoid high construction costs for 
transmission, but has suffered serious limitations from poor performance, licensing requirements, and high costs. 
5G has opened up new possibilities in the radio band, including multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) transmission 
that gives more concentrated beams and high-frequency transmission, although the latter is limited by distance. A new 
alternative technology that uses free-space laser communication is putting constellations of small satellites into low 
earth orbit (for example, Starlink by SpaceX). In this scheme, ground stations will transmit signals up to the 
satellites, which will relay them around the world using inter-satellite laser links to a point where they can be 
transmitted down to their destination. The goal is to bring broadband Internet to regions poorly served by terrestrial 
and submarine fiber cables.
The other important note is the delay in processing data between two points. The light speed in the glass is about 
200,000 km/s. So, the round trip to a data center of 1000 km away takes 5 ms; Which counts when steering a car at 
freeway speeds or in reacting to a possible medical event.
Reducing that latency will require building a mesh of data centers across the country. They would not have to be big, 
but they would have to be fast.</p><br>
